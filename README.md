# Social Network API 
Module 18 Challenge 

## Description 

This application runs as a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. In this assignment, we are using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

### Acceptance Criteria

`WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application` <br />
`THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database` <br />
`WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts` <br />
`THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON` <br />
`WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia` <br />
`THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database` <br />
`WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia` <br />
`THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list` <br />

## Installation 
To install the application, you will need to run a npm install for all the necessary packages in the terminal:

## Usage 
To begin using the application, you will require Insomnia to test the routes and its functions as this challenge only focuses on the backend of the web application.
